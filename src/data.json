Also used quite a bit of reach from there directly to the top hold while kind of just bracing thighs below. This clear definitely wasn't regulation but I want to count it anyway. I make the rules.

The penultimate position is RH grabbing 9 and 10, LH on 8, LF on 7, RF dangling. Doing a semidynamic one-legged squat (with pull-up assistance) to the finish is difficult but possible, not made mentally easier by the steel beam directly above your head.

Then get really close to the wall so that you can grab left to 8 and still stay stable. Hold 8 is really good! Much better than it looks, and versatile. From here, grab right to the top and bottom edges of the volume right around holds 5 and 6, giving you a bit of purchase to maneuver your balance up (pushing through LF) and dynamically grab to 9 and 10. These holds are awful individually but decent together; they can also get slippery, so chalk helps a lot. Get LF up to 7, stabilize, balance, prepare, and reach for the finish."

Technique is fairly straightforward: slap right hand to hold 2 sloper, match with left, then grab the pinch and maneuver up with strength. Get hands to the two lower dualtex holds and stand on hold 2. Then, on my first clear, I just dynoed right hand to the finish, went totally flying, and miraculously managed to slap it with my left and and stabilize.
