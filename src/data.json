Technique is fairly straightforward: slap right hand to hold 2 sloper, match with left, then grab the pinch and maneuver up with strength. Get hands to the two lower dualtex holds and stand on hold 2. Then, on my first clear, I just dynoed right hand to the finish, went totally flying, and miraculously managed to slap it with my left and and stabilize. On my second clear a week or so later, I managed to get the last hold statically by carefully grabbing to the lowest portion of it so that it can support you better in the downward direction."
