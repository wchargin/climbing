      "Flashed. (One start tape on the volume; don't see any other.) The hold under the volume is textured but extremely slick. Used the back side of the top corner of the volume, which is very strong: you can fully grip it. Would like to clear without so much aid. A friendly stranger suggests using the undercling at the end for that to help with the stand. Repeated on second try with much more legit use of the volume: I used the top lip in kind of the normal way, but didn't reach around the tip."

      "One thing I'm proud of here: I figured out before even getting on the wall that I would need to flag left on the start hold to prevent flagpoling. This would have been an easy adjustment to do live, but I'm happy I could see it ahead of time. Technique is fairly straightforward: slap right hand to hold 2 sloper, match with left, then grab the pinch and maneuver up with strength. Get hands to the two lower dualtex holds and stand on hold 2. Then, on my first clear, I just dynoed right hand to the finish, went totally flying, and miraculously managed to slap it with my left and and stabilize. On my second clear a week or so later, I managed to get the last hold statically by carefully grabbing to the lowest portion of it so that it can support you better in the downward direction."

      "The end is a breeze, once you're established on the antepenult (what would you call that hold??). But the start is tricky, getting up onto the hyperboloid! When facing out, jamming your right hip into it can be pretty useful. Once you're up and turned around and grabbing the pinch above it, left hand to the antepenult and shimmy down a bit before grabbing with the other hand. You will barndoor; gotta hold it and damp back when you hit the hyperboloid with your feet, then re-establish and finish up.",

But I'd done that part legitimately multiple times before, and on a subsequent attempt I legitimately did the start and up through being established turned around on the hyperboloid."

Once you grab left hand to the big hold on the top volume, you're pretty much good. Note that the hold above-right on the top face is black (it looks white in this photo)."

      "This one takes trust in the footholds as you move your feet ever closer and higher. In the cluster of these, finish with left foot on top-left and right foot on bottom-right. Reaching for the final hold is scary, especially as you go around that corner! On my first attempt I got there but was too afraid to commit. Got it on my second attempt. The arête is quite helpful in the middle for as long as it lasts.",

      "A novelty, having the start hold and the end hold be the same! On the newly set Wall of Dynos. Not super hard for me; vault up on the low volume and just kind of press into the underside of the end volume to stabilize: right hand pressing around the front edge, left hand pressing around the front edge or left corner. I can just stand there and don't need the lower black hold; I don't know how much height this requires."

    "notes": "Poked at the start: the angle on the big volume directly beneath the start hold is very shallow, and it's easy to slide off, and I didn't attempt it. Then I flashed it when I saw someone trying it out by pointing the toe of their left foot right into the volume, along the top edge maybe 60% of the way to the right. The end hold is very good in the way that it needs to be; you can grab behind it and hold on easily."
