From here, grab right to the top and bottom edges of the volume right around holds 5 and 6, giving you a bit of purchase to maneuver your balance up (pushing through LF) and dynamically grab to 9 and 10.

Technique is fairly straightforward: slap right hand to hold 2 sloper, match with left, then grab the pinch and maneuver up with strength. Get hands to the two lower dualtex holds and stand on hold 2. Then, on my first clear, I just dynoed right hand to the finish, went totally flying, and miraculously managed to slap it with my left and and stabilize. On my second clear a week or so later, I managed to get the last hold statically by carefully grabbing to the lowest portion of it so that it can support you better in the downward direction."

I used a hefty chunk of wingspan advantage grabbing to the top-right hold and then later grabbing to the finish hold, but it was definitely a legitimate clear.

Tried again today, and struggled to get to the middle. Watched someone clear it and saw them use their left hand on the hold right after that so that they could cross their right to the next. Tried that, but kept falling until I figured out that I could left-heel hook at that point to have much better stability on the right-hand grab. Then was able to clear it!

There's start tape on the bottom of the leftmost volume: I missed that originally, and \"flashed\" it with right hand on the marked start hold and left hand on the right pinch, only to realize upon further inspection that this wasn't a legal start. It's maybe slightly harder with the legitimate start, but not too much; cleared it properly on maybe the third proper attempt. There's nothing to help you above the top edge, but the edge itself is at a kind enough angle. The bottom-right hold (on the right volume) sticks out a lot, actually; it's much more present than I expected from the front view. Fully 60% of a sphere by volume."

        "Worked on this a bit on Wednesday the 25th, amid watching some other people with varying degrees of success. I love the crimps at the start, but struggled to get up to the top-left hold: when I have feet established on the two nubs, it feels like my center of balance is too low and I struggle to get up to the next hold without falling off the wall. In particular, my both my feet were pointing left, and my right knee was very bent as if to do a pistol squat (but that didn't feel like the right move, or I couldn't commit to it). It felt like part of the trick was switching my right foot to be pointing right. The second half of the climb also isn't super easy, and I failed it in isolation a few times, but thankfully I managed to clear it once I got there in a real attempt."

After holding the top two holds and standing with right foot on the top of the second hold (the upper start hold), two potential finishes: (a) stand with left foot on the lower volume and dyno to the top (I did to the right of the ducting, but you could probably do left, too), or (b) stand with left foot on the shiny side of the middle hold and pivot up. Approach (b) is easier than it might look. My normal vector against the dualtex had a significant rightward component, allowing me to lean back on the top hold and smoothly statically pivot to the top."

I start it from above, by placing my right toe on the nub on top of the volume, letting my left leg hang straight down, and placing my center of mass directly above the start hold. It's controlled and stable, so I think it counts as a legit start. Once you get on top of the volume, you need to commit to stepping up to the finish, which is psychologically a bit scary, especially with how rubberized the volume is around the hold. (Correspondingly, it helps to step only on the hold itself, not the surrounding volume.) The finish hold is not great; you can grab it, and it will cooperate, but only resentfully.",

Once you're standing and can stably reach your foot over to the next foothold, it still requires a bit of endurance but is pretty free of surprises.

        "Strengthy, but not as much as the route that was here previously (which I did not finish)! The trick here for me was to interact with the long vertical hold by grabbing the very top of it, with my right thumb in the groove and my other fingers pinching the outside. That was enough to prevent barndooring and give me the angles to ascend; attempts to grab the hold lower down were unsuccessful. The rest of the route requires strength but is fairly self-explanatory, I think."

        "Another quite tricky, precise, slabby/non-exerting black. The start is very awkward: I was consistently able to start, but in inconsistent ways, with my positioning changing a bit each time. The large lower hold that you perch on is effectively slippery, not so much from intrinsic texture as just based on how the angles work out. From the initial perch, standing is okay, though be careful around the volume—the first time that I slid off, I bonked my chin on the top face. (First time I've done that, though it's frequently something that I worry about. It actually barely hurt; I think I got lucky. After that fall, I was more careful about head positioning and avoided further incident.)",

For me, that move is surely the crux. Once you do that, you can shift weight left to grab it with your right hand, too, which rewards deliberate movement but isn't too hard. Then, either use the black chip or just smear to dyno up and grab the floating volume with left hand. That step and the subsequent scramble are pretty okay for me (a bit intimidating but still 100% success rate), though I've seen other people struggle with them.",

Once you're heel hooked in, dyno up right to the volume, then reposition and angle left to grab left to the giant half-moon so your wings are fully extended.

It's a cool route. I got some tips for the middle: once standing facing inward, move left hand to the smaller volume at far left and then eventually move left foot there, too.

On a subsequent clear trying different strategies, I was able to start that sequence with my right hand, too."
